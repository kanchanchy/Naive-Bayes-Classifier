# Naive Bayes Classifier
This repository loads train and test samples for digit 7 and digit 8 from mnist dataset. It then performs classification on the data using Naive Bayes Classifier.

Probability of each digit is calculated using normal density function. The digit that has higher probability is pedicted as the desired digit. In order to calculate univariate normal distribution, two features (mean and standard deviation) for each image are calculated.
